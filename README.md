# Babylon.js Template

A template for getting started with Babylon.js and TypeScript in a live, hot-reloaded and debuggable local VS Code development environment similar to the [Babylon playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/).

![](./docs/images/default-scene-in-browser.png)

## Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser-tools/)

## Getting started

1. Make sure Node.js is installed by running the following commands in a terminal:
   `node --version` and `npm --version`. You should see a version number displayed after each command is run.
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git and rename the directory to something other than "babylonjs-template".
1. In a terminal, `cd` to the cloned repository on your local machine and run `npm run boostrap` to install the base set of packages.
1. Open the cloned repository in VS Code and install the recommended extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`.
1. In VS Code's "Run and Debug" view, make sure the `http` target is selected in the dropdown and press the button with the green arrow on it to start debugging. This should build the project using webpack and launch Chrome with the default Babylon.js scene loaded. It should look like the image at the top of this page:
1. Modify [src/playground.ts](./src/playground.ts) and save it. This should make webpack rebuild the project automatically, and reload the page in the browser.<br>
1. Create a new Github repository, then set it as the origin and push your changes to it with the following terminal commands:
    ```
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your username>/<your repository's name>.git
    git add .
    git commit -m"Bootstrap Babylon.js template"
    git push
    ```
# Babylon.js Audio Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains a real-time audio visualization tool built using Babylon.js and the Web Audio API. The visualization processes audio signals and displays dynamic frequency-domain graphs within a 2D canvas overlayed on a Babylon.js scene. Designed for simplicity and ease of understanding, this project focuses specifically on the audio visualization implementation.

## Prerequisites
To set up and run this project, you will need the following tools installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - For cloning the repository and version control.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - For running the development environment and installing dependencies.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - For editing and debugging the code.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - Recommended browser for viewing the project.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minthom/babylonAudio.git
cd babylonAudio

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js packages by running:

npm install

3. Run the Project
Start the development server to view the visualization:
npm start

4. View in Browser
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8080

Features
Real-Time Audio Visualization:

Converts audio signals into a visual representation in real-time.
Displays frequency-domain graphs using a responsive 2D canvas.
Customization Options:

Adjust frequency ranges, bar density, and colors for a tailored visualization.
Lightweight and Focused:

This repository focuses purely on the audio visualization component, with clear and concise code.
How It Works
The Web Audio API is used to capture audio signals and process them into frequency data.
The frequency data is normalized and mapped to create dynamic visualizations.
The visual output is rendered on a 2D canvas overlayed on the Babylon.js scene.
The visualization updates in real-time, ensuring synchronization between the audio data and visual elements.

Customization
Modify the Audio Input
The default setup uses a sine wave oscillator as the audio input. To customize:

Open the src/visualization.js file.
Replace the default oscillator with another audio source, such as:
Microphone input.
Pre-recorded audio files.
Streamed audio data.
Adjust Visual Parameters
You can tweak the visual properties in src/visualization.js:

javascript
Copy code
const minFrequency = 20;      // Minimum frequency to visualize
const maxFrequency = 20000;   // Maximum frequency to visualize
const barColor = '#FF5733';   // Color of the bars
const backgroundColor = '#000'; // Background color of the canvas
Project Structure
This repository follows a clean and organized structure:

File/Folder	Description
src/	Contains the main JavaScript files for the visualization logic.
index.html	Entry point for the application.
styles.css	Styles for the visualization canvas and Babylon.js scene.
package.json	Defines the dependencies and scripts for the project.
README.md	Documentation for setting up and understanding the project.
Example Visualization
Below is an example of the real-time visualization output:


Future Enhancements
The following improvements could be added in future updates:

Custom Audio Inputs:
Allow users to input their own audio files or use live microphone input.
Additional Visualization Styles:
Add support for spectrograms or 3D visualizations.
Optimizations:
Improve performance on low-powered devices or older browsers.
Integration with Testing Tools:
Enable automated comparison of visualization results with reference images.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Solutions
Dependencies Not Installed:

Ensure you run npm install before starting the server.
Port Already in Use:

Check if another process is using port 8080. Kill the process or modify the port in webpack.config.js.
Visualization Not Appearing:

Check the browser console for errors.
Ensure your browser supports the Web Audio API and canvas elements.
